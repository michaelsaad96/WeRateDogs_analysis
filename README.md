# Wrangle and Analyze Data
This project gathers data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assesses it's quality and tidiness, then cleans it.
 We showcase our wrangling efforts through analyses and visualizations.
 ## How to Run this Project
 * The whole data analysis process, consisting of gathering, assessing, cleaning, storing, analyzing, and visualizing, can be viewed in `wrangle_act.ipynb`. This file can be viewed directly in github by simply left clicking.
 * Similarly, the wrangling efforts, as well as the analysis and visualizations results, can be viewed in `wrangle_report.ipynb` and `act_report.ipynb`, respectively.
 * `image_predictions.tsv`, `twitter-archive-enhanced.csv`, and `tweet_json.txt` contain the raw data, while `twitter_archive_master.csv` and `dog_table_master.csv` contain the cleaned data.
